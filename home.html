      <h3><strong>About Mason</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>Mason Ritchason (b. 2000)</strong> is an American composer and musician with a highly diverse,</p>
      <p>“melting-pot” musical background. Originally from Columbus, OH and raised in rural Mechanicsburg, OH,</p>
      <p>Mason’s upbringing was pivotal in his compositional style. Early exposure to Alternative and Rock music</p>
      <p>from the 1980s and 90s set him on an unorthodox path to classical composition that weaved through studies</p>
      <p>in Jazz, Heavy Metal, and Punk genres.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The product of this unusual musical fostering is an interest in the intensities of life. Following in the</p>
      <p>footsteps of mystic composers Olivier Messiaen and Alexander Scriabin, Mason expends his efforts delving</p>
      <p>into the depths of emotions and the shared human experience. The intensity of joy, ecstasy, and hysteria</p>
      <p>are dominant in the sounds he strives to produce, as well as mystery, uncertainty, and fear of the unknown.</p>
      <p>Stylistic integrities in Mason’s music come from a place of fusion, combining academic and sophisticated</p>
      <p>elements of classical music with the raw, powerful emotion of Hardcore, Heavy Metal, and Punk genres. 
      <p>The extensive color intrinsic to Jazz influences Mason’s harmonic language,</p>
      <p>where most of his musical experimentation takes place.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Mason is currently a student at Wittenberg University, from which he will receive two degrees in Music and</p>
      <p>Computer Science in the Spring of 2024. Mason also spent three years studying Education, which he now researches</p>
      <p>personally. As a trumpeter, he has performed extensively. During his time at Wittenberg, Mason has played in the</p>
      <p>school’s Symphonic Band and Jazz Ensemble and has performed in several solo and chamber recitals. After graduation,</p>
      <p>Mason plans to attend a prestigious graduate program where he will study Musical Composition and Theory,</p>
      <p>constructing a strong portfolio for a career in Education at the Collegiate level.</p>
